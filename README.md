# Hello World in Every Language

Welcome to the "Hello World in Every Language" repository! This project aims to be a comprehensive collection of "Hello, World!" programs implemented in as many programming languages as possible. Whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting your coding journey, this repository is a fun and educational resource to explore the diverse world of programming languages.

## What's Inside

In this repository, you'll find a growing collection of "Hello, World!" programs, each written in a different programming language. You can browse, contribute, or simply use these examples to discover the syntax and structure of various languages. Whether you're interested in high-level languages like Python and Java, or low-level languages like Assembly and C, we've got you covered.

## How to Contribute

We encourage developers of all skill levels to contribute to this project. If you'd like to add a "Hello, World!" program in a programming language that's not already in the repository, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new folder with the name of the programming language you're adding.
3. Inside the language folder, create a file named `hello_world.ext`, where `ext` is the file extension specific to that language (e.g., `.py` for Python, `.java` for Java).
4. Write a simple "Hello, World!" program in the chosen language.
5. Add a brief comment or documentation if necessary.
6. Submit a pull request to this repository.

Please ensure that your code adheres to the best practices of the respective programming language. We value clear, well-documented, and readable code.

## Contributions Guidelines

- Make sure your code is functional and follows the conventions of the language.
- Provide a clear comment or documentation if the language or code structure is not well-known.
- Respect the licenses and legal restrictions of the programming languages you include.
- Be courteous and helpful when interacting with other contributors through pull requests and issues.
